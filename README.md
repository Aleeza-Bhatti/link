# Link & Sync

Link & Sync helps UW students automatically sync class schedules with friends and discover others who are free at the same time — so meetups are easy without constant back‑and‑forth.

## What it does
- **Auto schedule sync** via Canvas ICS
- **Friend overlap view** to see shared free time at a glance
- **Link page** to find discoverable students free right now (opt‑in)
- **Privacy controls** to hide your schedule or limit visibility
- **Clean onboarding** with required profile fields and optional hobbies/IG

## Current status
- **Phase 1:** UI/UX complete
- **Phase 2:** Live data integration in progress
- **TestFlight:** launching soon
